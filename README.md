### **Why are we doing this?**
This project is to demonstrate what knowledges I got within Java Spring course. It helps to dive into backend development with JAVA.

### **How I expected the challenge to go**
I was'n expecting that I will spend less time

### **What went well? / What didn't go as planned?**
The start of project wasn't so smooth. When all issues were solved everything went forward quite fast.
Unfortunately not used full functionality for Jira Board.

### **Possible improvements for future revisions of the project**
I want to create a backend for my own project, so I will proceed with development.
